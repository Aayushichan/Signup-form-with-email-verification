# Signup-form-with-email-verification
I have built a Django web application that includes a signup form with email authentication, sign-in/out functionality, and a messaging feature. These skills demonstrate proficiency with Django, user authentication, and web development, which can be beneficial for job placement in web development or software engineering roles.
